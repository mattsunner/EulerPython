## About

This repository contains solutions to the Euler Project problems, solved using Python. Please note: Only view these solutions if you have already solved the questions on your own!

## How the Results are Laid Out

Each file in this repository is named according to the problem number on the Euler Project website, found [here](https://projecteuler.net/about). Within each file, there is a docstring located at the top containing the question text and link, as well as any other relevant notes. Next, the solution is listed out below. Finally, there is a docstring at the bottom of the script that contains the output, for quick reference.

## How to Run These Results

Development of these scripts was done using the Python 3.8 standard library whenever possible, in the event that a 3rd party library was used, it will be installed and noted in the `requirements.txt` file. Follow the steps below to use the scripts:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Install all dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the desired script using `python script-title-here.py`

Happy Coding!
